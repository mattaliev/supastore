## Introduction

Now, we have connected all the pieces together, but the bot still looks plain. In this guide we will learn how to customize our bot

## Tutorial

## Breakdown

To customize our bot, we have to navigate to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

We can find our bot by sending `/mybots` command and selecting our bot from the list

### Setting bot name, description, images and etc.

Once you selected your bot from the list, you will see few inline buttons. One of those inline buttons is `Edit Bot`. If you press on it for the first time, you will see something like this

```plaintext
Edit @my_supastore_bot info.

Name: Supastore Bot
About: ðŸš«
Description: ðŸš«
Description picture: ðŸš« no description picture
Botpic: ðŸš« no botpic
Commands: no commands yet
```

And there will be an inline button to edit each of those fields. Follow, the `@BotFather` instructions to customize your bot. 

When it comes, to commands. Supastore does not have any commands configured yet, except for `/start`. So you can set it to your bot. Once we create more commands, we will notify you about them and let you customize them


### Setting the Menu Button

If you had any experience with Telegram Bots and Web Apps, you will know that the easiest way to start interacting with it is through `Menu Button`

<img 
    href={"/images/menu-button-image.png"}
    alt={"Menu button image"}
/>

To set the menu button, go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and send `/mybots` command. Select your bot from the list and press `Bot Settings` inline button. Then you can press `Menu Button` and after `Configure Menu Button`. 

Send the URL of your store, that can be found in your `Supastore` settings page under `Telegram Bot` section. 

Provide the text you want to be displayed on the button and you are done!


### Setting your Store Logo

Navigate to your [Supastore Dashboard](https://admin.ditch-concept.com) Settings page. 

In the store logo section, you can upload logo for dark and light themes. The themes are adapted to customer's Telegram preferences.

It is recommended to 96x32 pixels logo with transparent background. Once you upload it, you will be able to see a preview of how it will look in your store. 

Don't forget to save changes, once you are finished
