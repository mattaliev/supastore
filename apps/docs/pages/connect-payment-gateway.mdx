## Breakdown

In your [Supastore Dashboard](https://admin.ditch-concept.com), navigate to `Payment Systems` page. In there, you will have a form for adding a new payment system.

Each payment system, needs to have a unique name for you to be able to differentiate between them.  

Then select a payment provider, for this tutorial we will choose `Bank Transfer`. We will go more in depth about other providers in the next tutorials.

You then need to provide button text. This will be displayed to your customer on the checkout page
