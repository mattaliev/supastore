## Introduction

With a rise of crypto currency, more and more businesses are starting to adapt it. At Supastore, we want to give you an opportunity to accept any payment you get. So, in this guide we will learn how to accept crypto currency

## Tutorial


## Breakdown

In your [Supastore Dashboard](https://admin.ditch-concept.com), navigate to `Payment Systems` page. In there, you will have a form for adding a new payment system.

Provide a name for this payment method, for this tutorial I would suggest something like "Crypto Payment".


Select `Crypto Transfer` in your provider options and enter Button Text that you want to display to your customer.

Enter the network and wallet address.

**Important:** Currency conversion has not yet been implemented in Supastore so we suggest using `USDT` wallet on `TRC-20` network.

Similar to Bank Transfer, once the user places an order, he will be sent a message with `Wallet Address`, `Network` and amount to send.
