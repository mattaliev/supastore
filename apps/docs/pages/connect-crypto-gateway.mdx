## Breakdown

In your [Supastore Dashboard](https://admin.ditch-concept.com), navigate to `Payment Systems` page. In there, you will have a form for adding a new payment system.

Provide a name for this payment method, for this tutorial I would suggest something like "Crypto Payment".


Select `Crypto Transfer` in your provider options and enter Button Text that you want to display to your customer.

Enter the network and wallet address.

**Important:** Currency conversion has not yet been implemented in Supastore so we suggest using `USDT` wallet on `TRC-20` network.

Similar to Bank Transfer, once the user places an order, he will be sent a message with `Wallet Address`, `Network` and amount to send.
