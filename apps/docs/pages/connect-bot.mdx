## Introduction

In the last tutorial, we have created a new bot, but this bot is kind of useless. It doesn't reply to any messages and it does not have a shop. Now, we will learn how to to power up this bot by connecting it to Supastore

## Tutorial


## Breakdown

In the tutorial we have mentioned, that in order for bot to function properly we need to do two things:

1. Connect our bot to Supastore
2. Connect Supastore to your bot

### 1. Connecting our bot to Supastore

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the bot token from @BotFather">
    In the previous tutorial, after we created a new bot, [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) sent us the bot token. If you lost that bot token, then you need to:
      - Navigate to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
      - Send `/mybots` command
      - Select your bot from the list
      - Press `API Token` on the inline menu
      - Copy the token
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Store Settings">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Insert the bot token">
    Under `Telegram Bot` section, insert bot username and bot token. Make sure to save changes after
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Connecting Supastore to our bot

Now we will connect supastore to our bot. For this we will need to create a new **Telegram Web App**

**Prerequisets**

- Store Image (must be 640x360 pixels exactly)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to @BotFather">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send /newapp command">
    Send `/newapp` command and select your bot from the list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow instructions to add title, description and photo">
    All these will be used when you are sending your store as an attachment

    **Note**: The store image must be 640x360 pixels exactly
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide the Web App URL">
    The Web App Url can be found in your **Supastore** settings page in the `Telegram Bot` sections. Just above the bot username and bot token input fields
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter short name for your web app">
    This will be on the end of your Telegram WebApp url

    `https://t.me/<your_bot_name>/<short_name>`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finished!">
    After finishing all the steps, `@BotFather` will send you URL for your Web App in this format

    `https://t.me/<your_bot_name>/<short_name>`

    **This is the URL you want your customers to access your Telegram Store through**
  </Step>
