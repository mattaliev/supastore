## Breakdown

Here is a breakdown of the steps from the tutorial

<Steps>
    <Step title="Go to @BotFather">
        Open the Telegram app and search for the user [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). This is the official bot for managing all Telegram bots.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Press Start">
        Start a chat with BotFather by clicking on the `Start` button.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Enter /newbot command and press Enter">
    </Step>
    <Step title="Follow the instructions to set a name and username for your bot">
    - The name can be anything you like.
    - The username must end in `bot`. For example: `my_supastore_bot`.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Save Bot Token">
    Once you've set the name and username, BotFather will provide you with an API token. **Save this token** as you'll need it to connect your bot to your application.

    ```plaintext
    Use this token to access the HTTP API:
    123456789:ABCDEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11
    ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
